# RealTime
RealTime is a full-stack virtual meeting app for scheduling and joining real-time video meetings. Built for seamless collaboration.



Sure! Here's a complete README.md for a Meeting App tailored for your personal portfolio. This document assumes the app allows users to create, join, and manage meetings — like a simplified Zoom or Google Meet clone, possibly with calendar integration, video calls, and notifications.

## 🧪 How to Run Locally

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/meeting-app.git
cd meeting-app

2. Setup Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the root of both frontend and backend directories with the following:

PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://...
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
EMAIL_USER=your_email
EMAIL_PASS=your_email_password
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000

Would you like me to tailor this for one of your actual repositories with your tech stack (e.g., Fastify, MongoDB, AWS, etc.) or generate a version with `Next.js` + `Socket.IO` + `S3`?




RealTime is a full-stack virtual meeting app for scheduling and joining real-time video meetings. Built for seamless collaboration.
Great question — to make your RealTime app stand out from typical meeting apps, you need to differentiate by features, user experience, integrations, or AI capabilities. Here are several unique angles you can add (choose what fits your vision and goals):


---

🔥 Ways to Make RealTime Different

1. AI-Powered Meeting Summaries & Action Items

Auto-generate meeting summaries using OpenAI or Amazon Bedrock.

Extract key decisions, action items, and deadlines after each meeting.


> 🧠 "Let AI take notes for you."




---

2. Smart Calendar Integration

Sync with Google Calendar or Outlook.

Suggest best meeting times based on all participants’ availability (like Calendly).

Auto-reschedule if the majority declines.


> 📆 "Scheduling that works around your life, not against it."




---

3. Instant Guest Access + Anonymous Join

Allow one-click guest access without login (with optional passcode).

Anonymous join with nickname for internal huddles.


> 🔗 "No logins. Just join."




---

4. Privacy & Security Focused

End-to-end encryption on calls.

Self-destructing links.

Meeting data stored locally or encrypted in S3.


> 🔒 "Meet safely, meet privately."




---

5. Integrated Task Board

Each meeting creates a board of tasks discussed (Trello-style).

Assign tasks to participants during the meeting.


> ✅ "From meeting to action — instantly."




---

6. Real-Time Collaborative Notes

Shared notepad or whiteboard during calls.

Markdown editor for tech teams, or mind-maps for brainstorming.


> ✍️ "Your team, one page."




---

7. Meeting Recording & Transcription

Optional recording saved to cloud (S3, Firebase, etc.).

Transcription powered by Amazon Transcribe or Whisper.

Time-stamped highlights or searchable transcripts.


> 🎙️ "Never miss a word."




---

8. Low-Bandwidth Mode

Toggle to audio-only or pixel-reduced video for poor connections.

Adaptive bitrate streaming via WebRTC.


> 🛰️ "Built for any network."




---

9. Gamified Stand-Ups & Icebreakers

For daily stand-ups, auto-timers and randomized speaking order.

Icebreaker questions or polls for remote teams.


> 🎮 "Meetings you won’t hate."




---

10. Mobile-First Experience or PWA

Designed as a Progressive Web App (PWA) or React Native mobile app.

Offline scheduling support, push notifications, and app-like UI.


> 📱 "Your meeting room in your pocket."
